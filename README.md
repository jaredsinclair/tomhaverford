Who says naming things is hard?

As I developed the app to manage the H<sub>2</sub>Flow<sup>TM</sup> Sparkle Points and Aqua Badges, I couldn't believe how confusing programming was. I realize that these nerds have just tried to keep playas like me out of the game by using words that don't make any sense. `String`?  What am I sewing buttons on a Baby Tuxedo<sup>TM</sup>?.  See, it doesn't make sense. `WordNecklace` takes away all the confusion so ballas like you and me can take it to the next level.

Jean Ralphio agrees, this is the best way to keep your Swift fresh
