# tomhaverford

Who says naming things is hard?

As I developed the app to manage the H<sub>2</sub>Flow<sup>TM</sup> Sparkle Points and Aqua Badges, I couldn't believe how confusing programming was. I realized that these nerds have just tried to keep regular folks like us out of the game by using words that don't make sense. String?  What am I sewing buttons on a Baby Tuxedo<sup>TM</sup>?. How are we supposed to get to a billion downloads if we can't communicate? How about `WordNecklace` instead. As you will see, `import TomHaverford` takes away all the confusion so you can take your code to the next level.

Jean Ralphio agrees, this is the best way to keep your Swift fresh.
